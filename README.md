The provided Java code implements a simple voice assistant using the Sphinx4 speech recognition library. Configured with acoustic, dictionary, and language model paths, the assistant continuously captures and processes voice commands. When a recognized command matches predefined actions, such as opening or closing the Chrome browser, the program triggers the corresponding runtime commands. This basic implementation showcases the potential of integrating voice recognition into Java applications, providing a foundation for expanding functionality and incorporating additional voice-activated tasks.
